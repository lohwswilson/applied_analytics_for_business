This is accomplished using both new and established scripting languages like Pig, Hive, and Python. Furthermore, specialized open-source tools such as Spark for streaming data and R for statistical analysis have also garnered considerable popularity. The process of adopting and utilizing open-source software represents a substantial shift, particularly for well-established businesses (How Analytics Has Changed in the Last 10 Years (and How It\u2019s Stayed the Same), 2017).</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/01_Introduction_to_Business_Analytics/20_page/#problem-solving-with-business-analytics","title":"Problem Solving with Business Analytics","text":"<p>Problem-solving using business analytics involves a structured process starting with problem recognition, precise problem definition, and structural breakdown. Data analysis is central, utilizing various techniques to interpret results and make informed decisions. The final step is implementing solutions based on insights gained.</p> <p>This systematic approach enables organizations to address challenges and seize opportunities by leveraging data-driven insights effectively (Cordes, 2014).</p> <p> 1. Recognizing a Problem: The first step in problem-solving using business analytics is recognizing that a problem or opportunity exists. This often involves identifying a specific challenge or a potential improvement in your organization's operations or strategies. For instance, a retail company might notice a decline in online sales despite increased website traffic, indicating a problem with conversion rates.</p> <p> 2. Defining the Problem: Once the problem is recognized, it needs to be precisely defined. This means clarifying the problem's scope, objectives, and the desired outcomes. Continuing with the retail example, the company might define the problem as \"low online conversion rates leading to decreased revenue.\"</p> <p> 3. Structuring the Problem: Structuring the problem involves breaking it down into manageable components and understanding the relationships between them. It often involves identifying relevant data sources and metrics that can provide insights into the problem. In the retail scenario, structuring the problem might involve looking at website traffic data, customer demographics, and purchase patterns.</p> <p> 4. Analysing the Problem: With a structured problem, you can start collecting and analysing data to gain insights. This step may involve using various analytical techniques such as statistical analysis, data mining, or machine learning. In our retail example, you might use customer behaviour data to identify patterns or correlations that shed light on why conversion rates are low.</p> <p> 5. Interpreting Results and Making a Decision: Once the analysis is complete, it's time to interpret the results. This means understanding what the data is telling you and how it relates to the defined problem. Based on these insights, you can make informed decisions. In the retail case, you might discover that certain customer segments have a higher conversion rate, leading to a decision to target marketing efforts specifically at those segments.</p> <p> 6. Implementing the Solution: Implementing the solution involves taking concrete actions based on your decisions. This could include making changes to processes, launching new marketing campaigns, or adjusting product offerings. In the retail example, implementing the solution might involve redesigning the website to improve user experience for the identified customer segments.</p> <p>To summarize, problem-solving using business analytics is a structured process that starts with recognizing a problem, defining it clearly, breaking it down into manageable components, analysing relevant data, interpreting the results, making informed decisions, and finally, implementing solutions to address the problem or capitalize on opportunities.

This measure quantifies the extent of symmetry, the level of peakiness, and the presence of outliers within the dataset.</p> <p>Various metrics exist to assess distribution shape, with some of the most common ones including:</p> <ul> <li>Skewness: Skewness measures the degree of asymmetry in a distribution. If a distribution is not symmetrical around its mean, it is considered skewed. Skewness can be either positive (right-skewed) or negative (left-skewed).</li> <li>Kurtosis: Kurtosis gauges the peakedness or flatness of a distribution. A distribution is described as kurtotic if its peak is more pronounced or flatter compared to a normal distribution. Kurtosis can be positive (leptokurtic), negative (platykurtic), or equal to 0 (mesokurtic).</li> <li>Outliers: Outliers are values that significantly deviate from the rest of the data points in a distribution. They can arise due to data collection errors or genuine variations within the population.</li> </ul> <p>The selection of the appropriate measure of distribution shape depends on the specific dataset and the objectives of the analysis. Skewness and kurtosis are often used in combination to provide a comprehensive description of a distribution's shape.

This analytical approach is bivariate in nature, focusing solely on examining the association between a pair of variables at any given time.</p> <p> The correlation coefficient serves as a metric for gauging the intensity of the bond between these two variables. It assumes values within the range of -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of +1 signifies a complete positive correlation, -1 indicates an absolute negative correlation, and 0 suggests no discernible correlation.</p> <p> The orientation of this association is conveyed by the sign of the correlation coefficient. A positive correlation coefficient signifies that both variables move in tandem, while a negative correlation coefficient implies opposing movements.</p> <p> For instance, suppose we have data detailing the heights and weights of 100 individuals. Using correlation analysis, we can explore the connection between height and weight. In this scenario, the calculated correlation coefficient is 0.8, signifying a robust positive correlation. Essentially, taller individuals tend to have greater weight, whereas shorter individuals tend to have lower weight.</p> <p> Correlation analysis can address various inquiries, including the presence of a linear connection between two variables, the degree of this association, its direction, and whether one variable can be utilized to predict the other.</p> <p> This method is adaptable and applicable across diverse domains such as psychology, sociology, economics, business, and medicine.

In the realm of creativity, there are no fixed rules for visualization; numerous methods exist for presenting data. However, when dealing with facts, figures, and measurements, a structured approach enhances understanding and effectiveness.</p> <p> For those new to data visualization, selecting the most suitable chart type can be challenging. Many individuals learn by emulating others' work without grasping the underlying rationale, resulting in a lack of theoretical understanding.</p> <p> Therefore, prior to embarking on data visualization, it is essential to consider the following:</p> <ul> <li>Determine the Purpose (Kosara 2016) - (Analytical or Presentational): Understanding why you are creating a visualization is crucial. Visualizations can serve various purposes, such as exploring and analysing data to enable viewers to discover insights on their own or presenting findings to raise awareness or make decisions. For instance, a journalist creating a weather report visualization aims to present key trends and inform the general public, while climate scientists use visualizations to convey their findings to policymakers regarding climate change action.</li> <li>Identify Your Audience (Mekhatria 2017): After clarifying the purpose, it's vital to know who the intended audience is. Regardless of the target audience, customization to their specific needs, interests, expertise, and analytical abilities is essential. Cultural preferences, expertise levels, and other factors, like colour symbolism in different cultures, play a significant role in designing an effective visualization. For example, in Chinese culture, red represents dynamism or positivity, whereas in much of the Western world, blue or green symbolizes positive trends, such as sales revenue. A visualization created for a finance analyst will differ from one designed for a marketing manager, highlighting the importance of customization for effectiveness.</li> <li>Choose the Right Chart Type (Mekhatria 2017): Once the purpose and audience are determined, selecting the appropriate chart type is crucial. This ensures that the visualization resonates with the audience and empowers them to explore data, uncover insights, and make decisions based on different scenarios.</li> </ul> <p>By addressing these questions, you can develop a clearer vision of the ideal chart for your data. A simplified guideline for using various chart types includes using line charts to track trends over time, bar charts for quantity comparisons, scatter plots for assessing the relationship between two data variables, bubble charts to depict the interaction of three data variables, and pie charts for comparing parts within a whole. However, let's delve further into various presentation styles and common chart types.</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/03_Data_Visualization/20_page/#basic-chart-type-and-graphs","title":"Basic Chart Type and Graphs","text":"<p>Charts play a vital role in the realm of data analysis, offering a means to distil vast data sets into easily comprehensible formats. Visual representations of data not only unearth insights for newcomers to the data but also effectively communicate discoveries to those who may not have access to the raw data. The vast array of available chart types each serves distinct purposes, and often, the greatest challenge in crafting a data visualization lies in selecting the most suitable chart type for the specific task at hand.</p> <p> The choice of the appropriate chart type hinges on several factors. Consideration should be given to the nature of the metrics, attributes, or variables slated for representation. Additionally, the intended audience plays a pivotal role \u2013 is the visualization primarily for personal exploration or destined for a broader viewership? Finally, the desired message that you wish the audience to glean from the visualization should guide your selection (Mike YiMary Sapountzis, 2019).</p> <ul> <li>Bar Chart: A bar chart employs bars to represent values, with each bar aligning with a specific category or group. These charts can be oriented either vertically or horizontally, with vertical ones often referred to as column charts. Opting for a horizontal bar chart is advantageous when dealing with numerous bars to visualize, or when labels necessitate extra space for clarity.</li> <li>Line Chart: Line charts depict fluctuations in values along continuous measurements, particularly when data is tracked over time. The upward or downward movement of the line highlights positive and negative shifts, revealing overarching trends that assist readers in making predictions or future projections. Additionally, multiple line charts can lead to the creation of related charts like sparklines or ridgeline plots.</li> <li>Scatter Plot: A scatter plot represents values on two numerical variables through points placed on two separate axes, each dedicated to one variable. Scatter plots offer a flexible means of illustrating the connection between these variables, whether the correlation is robust or weak, positive or negative, linear or nonlinear. They are also valuable tools for pinpointing outlier points and detecting potential data gaps.</li> <li>Box Plot: A box plot employs boxes and whiskers to provide a concise summary of value distribution within distinct measured groups. The positioning of the box and the ends of the whiskers indicates the central areas where the bulk of the data is concentrated. Box plots are frequently utilized when there are multiple groups for comparative analysis, while other charts with greater detail are favoured when dealing with a single group for representation.</li> <li>Histogram: When the groups represented in a bar chart involve continuous numeric ranges, it's possible to condense the bars to create a histogram. In histograms, the lengths of the bars usually represent the frequency counts of data points, and their configurations reveal the distribution of variables within your data. However, if the vertical value doesn't represent a frequency count, a different chart type, such as a line chart, is typically chosen.</li> <li>Stacked Bar Chart: A variation of the typical bar chart involves splitting each bar into several smaller bars according to values from a secondary grouping variable, known as a stacked bar chart. This approach enables you to not only assess the primary group values, as you would in a standard bar chart, but also visually represent the proportionate breakdown of each group's entirety into its individual components.</li> <li>Area Chart: An area chart shares a common basis with a line chart, featuring interconnected value points with line segments. However, it introduces an element from the bar chart, incorporating shading between the line and a baseline. This type of chart is frequently utilized in conjunction with stacking, effectively illustrating changes not only in the overall total over time but also in the contributions of its individual components.</li> <li>Bubble Chart: An alternative method for illustrating the connection between three variables involves adapting a scatter plot. If the third variable is categorical, various shapes or colours can be employed to denote group affiliation among the data points. If there's an inherent order to the data points, they can also be linked with line segments to depict the sequence of values. When the third variable is numerical, this is where the bubble chart becomes relevant. A bubble chart extends the fundamental scatter plot by using the value of the third variable to determine the size of each data point.</li> <li>Heat Map: The heatmap displays a grid of data points derived from two variables under consideration. These axis variables can take on numerical or categorical forms, and the grid is formed by dividing each variable into intervals or categories, similar to how a histogram or bar chart is constructed. The cells within this grid are coloured according to their values, typically with darker shades indicating higher values. When there's a substantial number of data points to represent, but their density makes it challenging to discern the genuine relationship between variables, a heatmap offers an intriguing alternative to a scatter plot.</li> <li>Pie Chart: Pie charts are used widespread. However, pie charts employ an unconventional representation, depicting values as segments carved from a circular shape. As pie charts usually don't include explicit value labels around their circumference, it can be challenging to precisely determine the size of each slice. Nevertheless, both the pie chart and its variation, the donut plot, are particularly effective at emphasizing that the primary focus of the visualization should be the comparison of parts to the whole.</li> <li>Map Plot: There are various categories of specialized plots organized by their intended applications, and in concluding this article, we'll briefly explore one of them: map-based or geospatial plots.

It's not about rigid symmetry on both sides of the visualization, but rather about even distribution of elements across the dashboard. It's crucial to consider non-data elements such as logos, titles, and captions, as they can influence the overall balance of the display.</li> <li>Emphasis: Emphasis involves directing the viewer's focus towards significant data by utilizing key visual elements. This principle is closely linked to the act of reading design principles. It entails being aware of what captures the viewer's attention in the artwork. When crafting data visualizations, it's vital to remain mindful of the central message and how the entire visualization guides or distracts the viewer's attention.</li> <li>Movement: Ideally, movement within a design should follow the natural reading pattern, starting from the top, moving horizontally, and then vertically. Movement can also be induced by employing complementary colours to guide the user's gaze across the page or through the use of animations.</li> <li>Pattern: Patterns are effective for presenting similar sets of data or datasets with equal values. Introducing disruptions in patterns can be a compelling way to pique the viewer's curiosity.</li> <li>Repetition: By repeating chart types, shapes, or colours, relationships between different datasets can be conveyed effectively.</li> <li>Proportion: Proportion plays a crucial role in indicating the importance of datasets and illustrating the actual numerical relationships. It can significantly enhance the viewer's understanding and experience. However, there is a risk of subconscious deception through proportion, as our brains tend to interpret data based on images. Hence, it's vital to accurately represent proportion in data visualization and remain critical of potential misuse.</li> <li>Rhythm: A well-designed rhythm is achieved when visual elements create a pleasing flow for the viewer's eye. Adjusting visual elements' arrangement can help achieve this when it's not naturally occurring.</li> <li>Variety: Variety in terms of colour, shape, and chart types captures and sustains the viewer's engagement with the data. Introducing variety can enhance information retention. However, excessive variety can lead to the oversight of critical details. When applied thoughtfully, variety complements balance and aids information recall, but overuse can result in visual clutter.</li> <li>Unity: Unity in design naturally emerges when all other design principles are effectively applied.</li> </ul> <p>These principles serve as guidelines for creating visually appealing and impactful data visualizations  (Anderson 2017).</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/03_Data_Visualization/40_page/#common-mistake-to-avoid","title":"Common Mistake to Avoid","text":"<p>The objective of data visualization is to effectively convey information to the intended audience.

This disorderliness can stem from a variety of factors, including device malfunctions, errors during data entry, or the amalgamation of data from disparate sources. To attain high-quality results from data mining that are not only actionable but also beneficial, it is imperative to rectify this disorderly data.</p> <p>Furthermore, data can be extensive both in terms of its size and the number of attributes it encompasses, which can lead to the concealment of significant patterns within its subcomponents. Hence, it is crucial to direct our attention to the pertinent sections of the data, considering both its volume and attributes.</p> <p>Data preprocessing plays a critical role in data mining and machine learning by ensuring the quality of the data used for analysis. Various factors are employed to assess data quality., including:</p> <ul> <li>Incompleteness:  Missing data in a dataset, resulting from various factors like data entry errors or transmission issues, poses a critical challenge in data preprocessing for data mining and machine learning. To maintain dataset completeness and reliability, preprocessing techniques like imputation are employed. Imputation involves estimating missing values based on available data, ensuring that statistical characteristics are preserved. This step is essential for accurate and meaningful analysis, as it enables data scientists to address missing data effectively and enhance the quality of the dataset for subsequent modeling and insights.</li> <li>Inconsistency: Inconsistent data, stemming from errors in data entry, integration, or storage, can introduce conflicts and contradictions in a dataset. Data preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning and data integration, are essential for detecting and resolving these inconsistencies. Data cleaning involves identifying and rectifying errors and standardizing formats, while data integration focuses on harmonizing conflicting data from multiple sources. By employing these techniques, data scientists ensure that the dataset is accurate and consistent, facilitating meaningful analysis and reliable model construction.</li> <li>Noise: Noise in a dataset, stemming from random or irrelevant data introduced during data collection or entry errors, can obscure meaningful patterns. Data preprocessing techniques like data smoothing and outlier detection are crucial for noise reduction. Data smoothing helps remove unnecessary variations, creating a more stable dataset, while outlier detection identifies and isolates data points significantly deviating from the majority, often erroneous or irrelevant, ensuring dataset integrity. These preprocessing steps result in a cleaner, more reliable dataset, facilitating accurate analysis and modelling.</li> <li>Outliers: Outliers, which are data points significantly differing from the majority in a dataset, can arise from various sources such as data collection or entry errors. Data preprocessing is instrumental in addressing outliers through techniques like detection and removal. Outlier detection systematically identifies these exceptional data points to prevent distortions in subsequent analyses and models, while outlier removal ensures dataset consistency and robustness. This preprocessing step enhances data quality, rendering it more suitable for accurate and reliable analysis and modelling, as illustrated by the example of an outlier student's exam score influencing the class's average performance analysis.</li> <li>Redundancy: Redundancy in a dataset denotes the presence of duplicated or overlapping data, often arising from processes like data integration or storage. To enhance dataset efficiency, preprocessing techniques such as data deduplication are employed. Data deduplication systematically identifies and eliminates duplicate data points, ensuring data uniqueness and preventing unnecessary replication. This streamlining process simplifies subsequent analysis and modeling, as exemplified by removing duplicate entries of the same customer in a customer database.</li> <li>Data format: Data format and structure in a dataset refer to how information is organized, encompassing various formats like text, numbers, or categories. Data preprocessing steps, such as data transformation and normalization, are vital for converting data into a consistent format for analysis. Data transformation involves altering data formats, aggregating or disaggregating, or creating new features, ensuring uniformity in data structure. Normalization scales numerical data to a consistent range, enhancing compatibility for analytical methods and allowing fair comparisons. These preprocessing techniques enable data scientists to work with a standardized dataset, promoting meaningful analysis and modelling, exemplified by converting product prices in various currencies to a common format in a product dataset.

Various factors can impact their accuracy, including the quality of input data and the complexity of the underlying algorithms. Consequently, it's vital to conduct periodic assessments of your predictive model to confirm its intended functionality.</p> <p> There are several techniques available for assessing the performance of a predictive model, each with its unique strengths and limitations. Here are some common approaches:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Holdout Testing: A straightforward evaluation method involves splitting your data into two sets: a training set used for model training and a testing set used for performance evaluation. While this method is easy to implement and provides a quick assessment of model accuracy, it's susceptible to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too tailored to the training data and struggles with new, unseen data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cross-Validation: To mitigate overfitting, many practitioners employ cross-validation. This technique divides the data into multiple subsets and trains the model on each subset sequentially, subsequently averaging its performance across all subsets. Cross-validation offers a more robust evaluation of the model's accuracy and aids in identifying potential overfitting issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis is a widely used method in binary classification problems, plotting Sensitivity (True Positive Rate) against 1-Specificity (False Positive Rate) at various thresholds. The resulting Area Under the Curve (AUC) measures a model's overall accuracy, with higher values indicating better performance. ROC analysis is particularly valuable when the costs of false positives and false negatives differ, allowing for threshold adjustments to prioritize one over the other. For example, in medical testing, ROC analysis helps strike a balance between minimizing false positives (unnecessary treatments) and false negatives (missed diagnoses) by selecting an appropriate threshold, ensuring informed decision-making.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a tabular representation that summarizes how well a predictive model's predictions align with actual outcomes in classification tasks. It comprises four elements: True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. From the confusion matrix, various critical metrics can be derived, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, each assessing different aspects of a model's performance. While the confusion matrix provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's behaviour, it may pose challenges for individuals unfamiliar with the associated terminology. Nonetheless, it's a valuable tool for understanding and fine-tuning models, especially when different types of prediction errors have varying consequences in practical applications.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These evaluation techniques offer diverse ways to gauge the effectiveness of predictive models, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of their performance and potential areas for improvement (Ashwani K, 2023).</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/06_Predictive_Analytics/30_page/#references-list","title":"References List:","text":"<ul> <li>Amy Gallo.

Unlike descriptive analytics, which focuses on historical data, or predictive analytics, which forecasts future outcomes, prescriptive analytics takes data analysis to the next level by suggesting the best course of action to achieve desired outcomes.  Prescriptive analytics involves using models like linear programming, sensitivity analysis, and simulation to make data-driven decisions. In the case of Fandango, these tools enable them to adjust ticket prices hourly based on demand and showtime availability, optimizing profits by identifying the most popular movie times (Asllani, A., 2015). </p> <p> Here's an in-depth look at prescriptive analytics and its applications, along with examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Retail: In the retail industry, prescriptive analytics can help optimize inventory management. Suppose a retail chain wants to minimize carrying costs while ensuring products are available to meet customer demand. Prescriptive analytics can factor in historical sales data, seasonal trends, supplier lead times, and cost constraints to recommend reorder quantities, reorder points, and pricing strategies. This enables the business to strike the right balance between inventory costs and customer satisfaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finance: Financial institutions use prescriptive analytics to make investment decisions. For instance, a portfolio management system may utilize prescriptive analytics to recommend an optimal mix of assets based on risk tolerance, market conditions, and return expectations. It considers various investment options and their potential impact on the portfolio's performance to guide investment choices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Healthcare: In healthcare, prescriptive analytics can assist in treatment recommendations. For instance, a medical decision support system may analyze a patient's medical history, symptoms, lab results, and available treatment options to suggest the most effective treatment plan. It considers factors like treatment efficacy, side effects, and patient preferences to guide healthcare providers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transportation: Transportation and logistics companies use prescriptive analytics to optimize routes, schedules, and resource allocation. For instance, a delivery company may employ prescriptive analytics to determine the most efficient delivery routes for its drivers, considering factors like traffic conditions, delivery windows, and vehicle capacities. This ensures timely deliveries while minimizing fuel costs and congestion.</p> </li> </ul> <p> Prescriptive analytics offers a wide array of benefits that can significantly impact organizations across various industries. Let's explore these benefits in more detail with examples:</p> <p></p> <p>1. Improved Decision-Making: Amazon's vast product catalogue requires precise inventory management. Prescriptive analytics helps Amazon determine optimal inventory levels for each product, considering factors like demand patterns, seasonality, and storage costs. This ensures that popular items are well-stocked while minimizing overstocking of less in-demand products.</p> <p></p> <p>2. Increased Efficiency: Example: Walmart optimizes the layout and product placement within its stores using prescriptive analytics. It considers factors such as foot traffic patterns, customer demographics, and product affinity to determine the ideal arrangement of products on store shelves. This not only enhances the shopping experience but also encourages cross-selling and impulse purchases.</p> <p></p> <p>3. Reduced Costs: UnitedHealthcare utilizes prescriptive analytics to identify patients who are at high risk of being readmitted to the hospital shortly after discharge. By analyzing patient data, including medical history, previous admissions, and clinical indicators, the system can pinpoint individuals at risk. This proactive approach not only lowers healthcare costs for both the insurer and the patient but also leads to better health outcomes by addressing potential issues before they escalate.</p> <p></p> <p>4. Improved Customer Satisfaction: Netflix employs prescriptive analytics to suggest movies and TV shows to its users. Algorithms analyse viewing history, genre preferences, user ratings, and real-time data on what other users with similar tastes are watching. This ensures that users receive tailored recommendations, keeping them engaged and less likely to cancel their subscriptions.</p> <p></p> <p>In each of these examples, prescriptive analytics doesn't just provide data insights; it offers actionable recommendations that organizations can implement to achieve tangible benefits. It empowers businesses to make informed decisions, streamline operations, cut unnecessary expenses, and enhance customer interactions. Ultimately, the goal of prescriptive analytics is to drive efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction, leading to improved overall performance and competitiveness (Catherine, 2021).</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/07_Prescriptive_Analytics/10_page/#travelling-salesman-problem","title":"Travelling Salesman Problem","text":"<p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has intrigued mathematicians for over a century, posing the challenge of finding the perfect route among a multitude of distant locations to minimize costs.

Its exceptional utility shines when an organization confronts the challenge of allocating finite resources across competing tasks to attain a set objective while navigating a spectrum of constraints.  Let's delve into the fundamental elements of linear programming and delve into instances of its practical application in the sphere of business analytics. Key Components of Linear Programming:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Objective Function:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Definition: In linear programming, the objective function represents the primary goal or objective of a business problem. It's a mathematical expression that must be either maximized or minimized. The objective could involve maximizing profits, minimizing costs, or optimizing resource utilization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example: Imagine a manufacturing company that produces two products, A and B, with a goal to maximize profit. Product A yields a profit of $10 per unit, and product B yields $15 per unit. The objective function to maximize profit (P) can be formulated as:</p> <p> P = 10x\u2081 + 15x\u2082</p> <p> Here, x\u2081 represents the quantity of product A to produce, and x\u2082 represents the quantity of product B to produce.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Decision Variables:</p> <ul> <li>Definition: Decision variables are the unknown parameters or choices that a business needs to determine as part of its decision-making process. These variables represent the quantities or actions under consideration.</li> <li>Example: In the manufacturing context, the decision variables are x\u2081 and x\u2082, which signify the quantities of products A and B to manufacture, respectively.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Constraints:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Definition: Constraints in LP are the real-world limitations or conditions that restrict the values of decision variables. Constraints must be satisfied for the problem to have a feasible solution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example: Let's introduce constraints into our manufacturing scenario:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The production capacity of a machine limits the total production of A and B to 100 units:</p> <pre><code>x\u2081 + x\u2082 \u2264 100\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Availability of raw materials restricts the production of A to no more than 60 units:</p> <pre><code>x\u2081 \u2264 60\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>There is a minimum production requirement for B, set at 20 units:</p> <pre><code>x\u2082 \u2265 20\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Feasible Region:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Definition: The feasible region is the set of all valid combinations of decision variable values that satisfy all the constraints simultaneously. It defines the region within which the optimal solution must be located.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example: In our manufacturing case, the feasible region is the overlap or intersection of the areas defined by the constraints in the x\u2081-x\u2082 plane. It includes all valid combinations that meet the capacity, material, and production requirements.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Optimization:</p> <ul> <li>Definition: Optimization is the central aspect of linear programming. It involves determining the values of decision variables that either maximize or minimize the objective function while staying within the feasible region.</li> <li>Example: Solving our manufacturing LP problem will yield values for x\u2081 and x\u2082 that maximize profit (P) while adhering to all the constraints. For instance, the solution could be x\u2081 = 60 and x\u2082 = 40, leading to an optimal profit of $1,400.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Solution Interpretation:</p> <ul> <li>Definition: After solving the LP problem, the results need to be interpreted within the context of the business problem. Decision-makers must understand the implications of the optimal values of decision variables for the organization.</li> <li>Example: In our manufacturing example, interpreting the solution means recognizing that to maximize profit, the company should produce 60 units of product A and 40 units of product B, resulting in a total profit of $1,400.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>These elements are the foundation of linear programming, a versatile tool that empowers organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions.

Nonetheless, we can identify five fundamental stages that primarily constitute most consumer buying decisions (Aimee Millwood, 2021):</p> <ol> <li>Problem Recognition: This is the stage where the consumer realizes they have a need or a problem that requires fixing. This realization may stem from internal triggers such as hunger and thirst, or external stimuli such as marketing adverts or recommendations from a friend.</li> <li>Information Search: Upon recognizing a need or problem, the consumer initiates a quest for information to find suitable solutions. This could take the form of seeking advice from acquaintances, scouring through online reviews, or comparing product prices on the internet.</li> <li>Evaluation of alternatives: After amassing sufficient information, the consumer starts assessing the various alternatives at their disposal. This typically involves comparing elements such as price points, features, and brand reputation.</li> <li>Decision to purchase: After careful evaluation of the available options, the consumer arrives at a purchasing decision. Various factors, including price, quality, convenience, and brand loyalty, may weigh in on this decision.</li> <li>Post-purchase assessment: Once the consumer has finalized and made their purchase, they perform an evaluation to determine their satisfaction level with the product or service.

Customer segmentation refers to the categorization of customers into clusters based on shared attributes and behaviours. On the other hand, customer profiling is the practice of preparing comprehensive narratives of individual customers, utilizing their demographic, psychographic, and behavioural data. Data analytics plays a vital role in facilitating both customer segmentation and profiling. Marketers can harness data analytics to discern groups of customers who display similar purchasing habits, demographic structure, or interests. Such insights can then be employed to devise marketing campaigns and communication tailored specifically for each customer division, thus enhancing its appeal.</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/09_Business_Analytics_in_Marketing/10_page/#customer-segmentation","title":"Customer Segmentation","text":"<p>This is the process of dividing a company's market into distinct categories or segments, each characterized by specific demographics or behavioural traits. These segments are created based on common characteristics like age, location, spending habits, brand interactions, etc.</p> <p> Example: A grocery store chain may identify that they have segments of customers such as families with young children, university students, and older retired couples. Each of these groups are likely to have different grocery shopping habits and preferences. Families might have more regular, large-volume purchases and a preference for delivery services, students might favour budget options and shop irregularly, and older couples might prefer to shop in person during off-peak hours and buy specialty products. By identifying these distinct segments, the grocery store chain can tailor marketing, promotions and even store layout to better meet the needs of each group.</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/09_Business_Analytics_in_Marketing/10_page/#customer-profiling","title":"Customer Profiling","text":"<p>This further refines the segmentation process by creating a detailed description of the typical customer in each segment. Customer profiling looks at the demographics, lifestyle choices, preferences, and behaviours of customers to create these \"archetypes\" or \"personas\" in each segment.</p> <p> Example: Within the segment of \"families with young children\" identified by the grocery store chain above, a customer profile might be developed. This profile could include information like: \"Typically does a large shop once per week, prefers organic produce and meat, frequently purchases children's snacks and lunchbox items, uses home delivery service, responsive to sales and children's product promotions, often browses recipes and family meal ideas on the store's website.\" This detailed profile allows for even more targeted marketing and service delivery compared with segmentation alone.</p> <p> This advanced understanding of their customer base assists businesses to implement strategies and initiatives that are more likely to fulfil their customers' needs, thereby increasing satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, profitability (Walters, M., &amp; Bekker, J.. , 2017)..</p> <p> Here are some real-world examples of how firms are employing data analytics for customer segmentation and profiling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon: Utilizing data analytics, Amazon differentiates its customers into multitude clusters, founded on their purchase records and browsing pattern. This information is then put to use by Amazon for individualizing its website and proposing product recommendations suitable for each customer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Netflix: Netflix harnesses the power of data analytics to separate its customers into myriad groups, built based on their watch history and predilections. This input is then utilized by Netflix to suggest new movies and series to every customer, tuned to their likely interests.</p> </li> <li> <p>Starbucks: Starbucks capitalizes on data analytics to classify its customers into distinct segments, established on their purchase history and interactions with the mobile application.

A study conducted by Bain &amp; Company revealed that 81% of executives considered segmentation as an essential factor in increasing profits. The study also highlighted that over a span of five years, companies that employed effective market segmentation strategies boasted profits that were 10% higher than those of businesses with less effective segmentation. Key benefits of customer segmentation and profiling with examples (Qualtrics. ,n.d.).</p> <ul> <li> <p>Improved marketing effectiveness: When a business has a comprehensive understanding of its customers' behaviours, preferences, and needs, it can create marketing campaigns that are specifically tailored to each customer segment. This improves the relevancy of the marketing messages and enhances the chances of customer engagement.</p> <p>Example: A skincare company, through segmentation, identifies a group of customers who are vegan and interested in animal-free products. The company then tailors marketing campaigns for this segment emphasising its vegan, cruelty-free skincare line. This targeted approach will connect more meaningfully with this segment, resulting in a higher engagement rate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Increased sales: Effective customer segmentation allows businesses to focus marketing efforts on customer groups that are more likely to purchase their products or services. This targeted marketing likely leads to an increase in sales and revenue.</p> <p>Example: An online bookstore, through customer profiling, identifies that a certain segment tends to purchase mystery novels. The bookstore can promote newly arrived mystery novels to this segment, resulting in increased sales from this segment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved customer satisfaction: Understanding customer needs and wants helps businesses adapt their services and products accordingly, leading to improved customer satisfaction.</p> <p>Example: A hotel recognises, through customer profiling, that a significant portion of their customers are business travellers. The hotel can improve satisfaction for this segment by providing services such as express check-in/out, business centres, and meeting rooms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduced marketing costs: With the targeted marketing approach that customer segmentation and profiling allows, businesses can focus their resources on high-return segments, reducing the costs and waste associated with broad, undifferentified marketing.</p> <p>Example: A high-end fashion retailer understands that their products appeal to a niche market segment that values luxury. Instead of spending on mass marketing, the retailer targets its resources on this specific segment through high-end fashion magazines and events, reducing costs while ensuring that the marketing messages reach the right audience.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/09_Business_Analytics_in_Marketing/20_page/","title":"Marketing Campaign Analytics","text":"<p>Marketing Campaign Analytics</p> <p>Marketing campaign analytics is a vital tool used by marketers to quantify, analyze, and interpret data generated from their marketing campaigns. This process aims to evaluate their campaign's performance and identify potential opportunities for improvement. This goes beyond simple data collection, diving into metrics such as campaign reach, the number of impressions made, the click-through rate (CTR), conversion rates, and the overall return on investment (ROI) (Elena Linker, 2023).</p> <p>\u2022   For instance, the 'reach' metric reveals the number of unique users exposed to a particular campaign. This figure can assist in assessing whether you\u2019re targeting your desired audience effectively. 'Impressions', on the other hand, show the number of times an ad from the campaign was displayed, giving totality overview of campaign visibility.</p> <p>\u2022   The click-through rate (CTR) indicates the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view the campaign or ad. This metric can help determine the success of an individual advertisement or campaign on a website. Similarly, the conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who complete a desired action (like making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter), offering insights about campaign persuasiveness and effectiveness.</p> <p>\u2022   The return on investment (ROI) is a key financial metric that is widely used to measure the probability of gaining a return from an investment. It compares the magnitude and timing of gains from an investment directly to the costs.</p> <p>Campaign analytics provides several benefits to the marketers:</p> <ol> <li>Performance tracking: By comparing the initial goals of the campaign against the actual results, marketers can understand what worked well and what didn't. This can shed light on potential areas to tweak for better performance.</li> <li>Campaign optimization: With detailed metrics and insights, marketers can fine-tune various aspects of their campaigns, from ad copy and landing pages to audience targeting, helping to boost overall effectiveness.</li> <li>Audience insights: Analytics can reveal how different audience segments interact with campaigns, providing valuable insights into customer behaviour and preferences.</li> <li>Measuring Impact: It allows the marketers to directly map the impact of their campaigns on their business KPIs like sales growth, market share enhancement etc.</li> <li>Data-Driven decisions: Armed with tangible data, marketers can make informed choices about where to invest resources in future campaigns for optimal effect. Future campaigns can be planned better with preceding empirical data, improving efficiency and effectiveness.</li> </ol> <p>2.1 Common Data Sources for Campaign Analytics</p> <p>In the process of marketing campaign analytics, there are various methods to collect data that provide a wealth of insights into user behavior, engagement, and overall campaign performance. Here is a detailed discussion of the methods mentioned:</p> <p>1   Web analytics: This method uses tools like Google Analytics to track the number and behavior of visitors to a company's website. The collected data can provide valuable information about how users find the website, what pages they visit, how long they spend on each page, and what actions they take. For instance, a sudden increase in visits may indicate a successful marketing campaign, while increased bounce rates (people leaving the site after viewing one page) may suggest that the website is not effectively engaging visitors. This information can help marketers understand what aspects of the website are working well and where improvements are needed.</p> <p>2   Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems: CRM systems serve as an organized database of valuable customer information. These systems can track every interaction a company has with its customers, ranging from initial contact as a prospect, to sales leads, customer support tickets, and feedback. CRM systems can simply tell who the customers are, what products they purchase, when their purchases take place and much more. By analyzing this data, businesses can understand their customers more deeply, predict future behavior and identify opportunities for up-selling or cross-selling.</p> <p>3   Social Media Analytics: Social media platforms host a wealth of user engagement data that can provide valuable insights for a marketing campaign. Utilizing tools like Facebook Insights or Twitter Analytics, companies can track metrics like likes, shares, comments, retweets, and mentions. Not only do these metrics show the level of engagement a campaign is driving, it can also help in identifying the type of content that resonates most with the audience - be it informational blogs, interactive posts or promotional ads.</p> <p>4   Email Marketing Analytics: Email continues to be a powerful marketing tool, and with analytics, companies can measure the effectiveness of their email campaigns. Tools like MailChimp or Constant Contact offer insights into email open rates, click-through rates (CTR), and unsubscribe rates. Open rates can give an idea of how effective an email's subject line is, while CTR can tell you how engaging and relevant the content is to the audience. Unsubscribe rates could point out if the frequency of mails sent is causing annoyance or email content is not of interest to recipients. These comprehensive metrics can assist in optimizing the campaign.</p> <p>To provide an example, consider a retail business launching a new product line. They could use web analytics to see a surge in website visits after the launch, CRM data to track new inquiries and sales, social media analytics to measure engagement on their launch announcement post, and email analytics to gauge the effectiveness of their product launch email campaign. This multi-channel analysis can help identify the success factors and improvement areas for future campaigns (Todd Juneau, 2023).</p> <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis</p> <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), also known as CLTV, is like a report card on a customer's economic value to your company from their first purchase to their last. It is a tally of all the profits, beginning with their first buy, their repeat buys, and how long they continue to buy from your company.</p> <p>It's like a measuring tape to see how loyal customers are to your brand. If you find the same customers regularly buying from you, it's a good sign you're likeable and you're winning at your business tasks. Plus, the higher the CLV, the less you have to spend to get new customers.</p> <p>To make it more relatable, let's take a look at a few examples.</p> <p>For instance, let's say a Honda car owner is happy with their vehicle, they might end up buying more Hondas in the future and their total CLV could reach up to $100,000. The CLV of a coffee enthusiast can also be high depending on how much coffee they drink daily and where they get it from. On the other hand, a person buying only two homes in their lifetime could have a CLV of roughly $15,000 to a real estate agent. Although the home price is high, the agent's commission is just a small fraction.</p> <p>In essence, customer lifetime value is like a yardstick for the potential profit a specific customer brings, and it should guide how much you're ready to invest to keep them. For instance, if a customer's CLV is $500, it would not make financial sense to spend more than that to retain them.</p> <p>A good comprehension of your CLV can be a big help in shaping your business plans. If you know your CLV well, you might focus more on keeping your current customers happy, instead of using resources to get new ones. Of course, both new and current customers are important to grow your business.</p>"},{"location":"Course_Materials/09_Business_Analytics_in_Marketing/30_page/","title":"Customer Lifetime Value Analysis","text":"<p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), also known as CLTV, is like a report card on a customer's economic value to your company from their first purchase to their last.

The problem first became apparent at their Frankfurt hub, creating a ripple effect that was displeasing to their customers and hurtful to their business.</li> </ul> <p> A significant incident that contributed to the declining customer satisfaction ratings involved a case of severe misconnection. Unfortunately, four passengers bound to London missed out onto their designated flight due to this connectivity issue. And to make matters worse, there were only two vacant seats left on the last flight scheduled for the day. Speculating from the ground reality, Air London was put in a tough position struggling to find a satisfactory solution to re-accommodate these four aggrieved passengers.</p> <p> The quest to resolve the misconnection crisis was not a smooth one either. To establish the root cause, the staff needed to sift through various data sources manually. This was an onerous and time-consuming task that relied heavily on human effort and lacked the benefit of technological aid.</p> <p> Further compounding the issue was a technological deficit within Air London's operational setup. There was a glaring lack of real-time visibility pertaining to flight cancellations, postponements, and other relevant operational issues. This inadequacy hindered the efficient management of passenger connections, leading to an environment of uncertainty and inconvenience both for the passengers and the airline.</p> <p> In summary, Air London faced a twofold problem - on one front there was a needs-based improvement for technological infrastructure, and on the other, there were operational challenges that required robust solutions for improving customer service and general business performance.</p> <ul> <li>Proposed Solution: Detailed Insights into the Misconnect Situation.  In response to the troubling misconnect circumstances at Air London, the team put forth a practical and data-driven recommendation to mitigate the problem. This solution involved the implementation of a real-time data warehousing methodology that capitalised on the strength of analytics technology.  The aim was to use its capabilities and mold them into an effective solution to Air London\u2019s predicament.</li> </ul> <p>The proposed method endorsed the idea of secure storage for passenger data. The mode chosen for this storage was a relational database, a prevalent repository type that uses a structured scheme to store data. To optimally analyse this systematically stored data and derive critical insights, they decided to utilise powerful predictive modelling tools provided by the SAS group and Teradata Value Analyzer. The joint use of these tools allowed for an extensive and insightful exploration of the databank in real time.</p> <p> A significant aspect of this data analysis process was the selection of superior rebooking variables. These variables, chosen with careful consideration of their impact and relevance to the business, included elements such as frequent flyer miles, lifetime value, booking frequency, profitability, and the cost and utilization of different channels. Moreover, any unusual circumstances, such as exceptional flight delays or cancellations, were also added to the list of considerations. These rebooking variables served as a comprehensive toolkit for identifying and understanding customer requirements and behavioural patterns. These data-driven strategies were formulated with the objective of achieving a triple-fold effect. First and foremost, they endeavoured to maximize customer satisfaction by making rebooking a seamless and hassle-free experience. Additionally, on a broader and more strategic note, these tactics aimed to maintain, if not improve, the profitability of the airline.

The alarming episode began when fraudulent transactions linked to credit cards were reported to the clearing bank.</li> </ul> <p>This unusual activity underlined a potential security weakness in the credit card mechanism, possibly pointing towards an uncomfortable scenario involving hackers. A security breach of this nature does not just expose sensitive customer information; it also threatens the trust built between the business and its clientele.</p> <p> Adding to the problem was the absence of a centralized data storage system. In an age where data comparison and trend analysis are critical to proactive security measures, this absence posed serious challenges. It made it troublesome for the IT department to compare system data, thereby hindering their efforts in vulnerability detection and system fortification.</p> <p> These obstacles made it particularly hard to identify the exact source of the security breach. After a thorough initial investigation involving both front-end and back-end systems, the results illustrated a rather surprising picture. The systems were found to be free of any external intrusions and the role and time-based security access controls, set in place using a reputable data protection and security software solution, Protegrity, showed no signs of security risk.</p> <p> These findings prompted a change in perspective, suggesting that the problem might be originating from within the system rather than an outside source. This suspicion grew stronger when an unusual query was discovered in the system. The query - select *, typically used to retrieve all data from a database, was implemented on orders and customers. This abnormal query activity coupled with the suddenly ceased credit card data 'touches' in the SQL servers painted a worrying picture.</p> <p> In addition, the IT department had been using a different operational database system, Oracle, that did not fall under the safety net of Protegrity's surveillance. The use of an unmonitored operational database system could potentially have created an unseen vulnerability, providing further insights into the complexities of this case. The situation at hand required a solution that was both comprehensive and effective, something robust enough to handle the scale and severity of the issue.</p> <ul> <li>Proposed Solution: In-depth Overview of the Credit Card Breach In the wake of the disruptive credit card breach within the organization, the team stepped up with a robust and well-architected data warehousing solution. It was a comprehensive strategy built atop the leading-edge data analytics technology aimed at stopping similar breaches in the future and strengthening the overall security structure. This technology has made its mark in the industry for masterfully handling large data sets and performing complex queries at high speeds, making it a suitable pick given the circumstances..</li> </ul> <p> The solution was to amalgamate multiple, scattered consumer data sources into one cohesive data warehouse. This unified data storage would make it easier to manage, monitor, and analyse the diverse data sets in a real-time environment. More importantly, it could provide valuable insights into any anomalous activity and serve as an effective early warning system for potential security breaches. Simultaneously with the technical measures, a client-facing strategy was also devised to manage the ongoing crisis efficiently. Immediate steps were taken to communicate the issue to the customers, employing both phone calls and letters. Both these channels were utilized to deliver new credit cards to the affected customers promptly. These interactions were not just transactional, thought. The communications also encompassed heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience caused to the customers and earnest assurances of improved security measures. </p> <p> A structured follow-up system was put in place as well, with subsequent phone calls ensuring that the customer concerns are addressed, and their confidence in the company was being reinstated. Another aspect of the new security strategy was to incorporate Protegrity software into the company\u2019s IT ecosystem. Known for its state-of-the-art data security solutions, Protegrity would help reinforce the protection around the organization\u2019s data centres, ensuring the stored data\u2019s safety and integrity. Lastly, the company decided to pursue an external audit of the ongoing security measures. Recognizing the need for an unbiased and expert evaluation of the security solutions, The team called in qualified auditors to perform a thorough Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance audit.

Combining narratives and visual elements, it portrays the insights derived from data analysis in a manner that is comprehensible and engaging. This technique allows the audience to grasp the significance of these insights in a specific context, and compels them toward actionable steps.</p> <p> The three fundamental components that structure an impactful data storytelling are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data: The inception of a data story is a comprehensive and exact analysis of data. Exploiting methods like descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis constructs a panoramic view of the data. For instance, a descriptive analysis could show a drop in a product's sales, diagnostic analysis could reveal the reasons behind the drop, predictive analysis could indicate future trends if the situation persists, and prescriptive analysis could suggest solutions to revert the trend.</p> </li> <li> <p>Narrative: The narrative or storyline, whether conveyed orally or written, breathes life into the numbers and facts derived from the data analysis. It presents the insights in a coherent and eloquent manner, explaining the context and promoting the recommended actions. In the same sales drop situation, the narrative could reveal a competitor's aggressive pricing strategy caused it, and suggest launching a targeted promotional campaign to regain market shares.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visualizations: A picture is worth a thousand words, and this fits perfectly in the context of data storytelling. Visual elements such as charts, graphs, diagrams, images, or videos transform complex numerical data into clear, engaging, and memorable content. A sales trend graph, for example, could visualize the product's dropping sales and offer a forecast of future trends considering the competitive pricing. Data storytelling can serve both internal and external purposes. Internally, it can highlight the need for enhancements in a product based on user feedback data or reveal the effect of a marketing campaign on customer acquisition. Externally, it can powerfully show potential customers the merits of your product based on the success stories and thereby assist in sales growth (Catherine Cote, 2021).</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
